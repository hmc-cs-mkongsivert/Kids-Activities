"In Cabaret We Trust is a fully-immersive theatre experience that begins as soon as the audience arrives. It is set within the walls of the 15,000+ sq. ft. desanctified church, Blind Whino. This immersive production will highlight not only the acts on the main stage, but also the tangled web of stories just below the surface. Drawing on influences from the Weimar Republic era, the production explores themes of power and control, as well as resistance and artistic spirit. Artistic director Strother Gaines says, In my research following the 2016 election, I started seeing parallel storylines between the Weimar Republic and the previous 8 years here in DC. Back then, as the pendulum swung back to a fascist regime, we lost the cultural progress of the early Weimar Republic. It makes us nervous to see the increasingly similar parallels to today’s political landscape.", 1

"The idea of Small Steps are Giant Leaps came to Astronaut Harrison's Dad while riding the bus with his 4 year old son, what was a normal everyday event to him had his son completely transfixed. Seeing that look of amazement on his face, at something so common place, really struck him. In that moment he realized that his son is an explorer and the everyday world that we take for granted to him is an amazing place filled with new sights and experiences.  He knew in that moment that he wanted to somehow document his son's journey of exploration. 18th months, 3 spacesuits, 2 helmets, and more than 50 photo shoots later, Astronaut Harrison's Dad is so proud of his little astronaut. Astronaut Harrison really enjoyed working on the project and used the experience to help him get over several childhood fears. They shot everywhere from the museum to the city pool and have traveled from dusty country roads, to the Florida Space coast and right here in Washington, D.C. They've had great support from people inviting them to photograph in movie theaters, old school barber shops, expensive hotel rooms, and, back where it all began, on the city bus. We hope these images will help be a reminder for you to take a moment and make a new discovery or explore a little bit more of your world, every single day.", 1

Last seen at the Kennedy Center in 2011, the company returns to the Opera House stage with two extraordinary ballets—Artistic Director Alicia Alonso’s definitive staging of the romantic classic Giselle with choreography after Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot and its acclaimed version of Don Quixote choreographed by Alicia Alonso after Marius Petipa.

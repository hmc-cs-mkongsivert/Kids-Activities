# Kids' Activities
### A Website to Keep Track of Educational Events for Children

## Overview
This repository is meant to create and maintain a website that gathers information from various locations that regularly host events and gather their schedules into one place so that parents don't have to go searching around the internet to find events for their children. The idea is meant to be expandable to any number of cities, but for the moment, we only have events for Washington, DC.

In terms of the actual files in this repository, most of the heavy lifting is done by the Python scripts (and by [HTML5 UP](html5up.net) for creating the lovely template that we used to make this website). The Python scripts gather information about upcoming events from various institutions around Washington, DC and insert them into the HTML files for the website.

## Required Libraries
The Python libraries required to run these scripts are:
- TensorFlow
- MatPlotLib
- Numpy
- CSV

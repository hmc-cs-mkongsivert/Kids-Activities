<th>Born in Togo, West Africa and raised in Washington, DC, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tabibonney/">Tabi Bonney</a> follows in the footsteps of his activist-musician father, Togo born Itadi Bonney, who spent his life focused on one singular mission: &nbsp;to bring the “music” of “home” to the US. As an artist in music, Tabi earns domestic and global radio and TV exposure, and has performed on stages all over the world. As an entrepreneur, Tabi produced and distributed his own fashion line, bonneyrunway, which would lead to collaborations featuring product designs with African fabrics and prints.&nbsp; As a video director, Tabi works with emerging talent everywhere from Washington DC to LA to Togo. Like his father, in his style and in his work, Tabi finds himself expressing about “home.” Through his portraits on display, Tabi is expressing, for the first time, for East Africa, for Ethiopia, one of the most magical and stunning “homes” he’s ever visited. &nbsp;</th>
